On macOS/Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

On Windows:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Step 3: Install Requirements

Install the project dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Run the Project

Start the project using the appropriate command:

Example:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### Step 5: Deactivate the Virtual Environment

To deactivate the virtual environment, run:

```bash
deactivate
```
